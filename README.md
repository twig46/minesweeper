This is a project I am working on for Hack Club's Summer of Making (https://summer.hackclub.com/projects/11913) although if you are here you probably already know that.
This is a basic recreation of minesweeper with anything I think should be in a proper minesweeper clone.
Right now I am just getting the base game working but I do have a few ideas to extend it past that point.
